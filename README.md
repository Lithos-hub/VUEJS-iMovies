iMovies is a web app I'm developing using Vue. 

This application uses The Movie Database (TMDB) API to show info about movies (release dates, titles, vote average, overviews, etc).

The app is divided into some sections that can be accesible by the expandible side menu:

* Famous current movies (Trending).
* The latest available movie trailers (Trailers);
* Movies classified by genres and popularity (Genres);
* And a popular movies classification by year, from 2010 to 2020.

In some of those sections you may get or access certain info with buttons that trigger a modal window.

Also, since Version 1.5 you can create your own movie lists in some categories like Watched Movies or Favorite Movies. That information can be watched in My Movies section.

Little by little, I try to expand the possibilities of the application with each version.
